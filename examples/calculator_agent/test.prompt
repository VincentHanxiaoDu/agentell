What is the result of 2 to the power of 4 minus 11213?
What about a more complex one: take the sum of two plus thirty three first, and then multiply it by 4, after that take a modulo of 4
Are there any further optimization techniques we can apply to the second problem? For instance, what if the 'two plus thirty-three' component involves a computationally intensive operation?
